# About Me
**Hey there, I’m Romand from Portland, Oregon!** 👋  

As a **Data Analyst**, I blend my experience in **food and beverage hospitality** with a passion for uncovering actionable insights. With over a decade of hands-on problem-solving in high-pressure environments, I’ve learned how to **adapt quickly, think strategically**, and deliver impactful results.

I’m passionate about using data to **optimize processes** and create smarter solutions, whether it’s a **local coffee shop** or a **large-scale operation**.  

## 🏀 Data with a Purpose  
I see data as a team sport:  
🏆 **Slam dunks** = When data drives meaningful **business transformation**.  
💭 **Assists** = Helping teams make **data-informed decisions** that lead to action.  
❌ **Airballs** = Every missed shot is an opportunity to **refine strategies**.

- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Spreadsheets  
- **Business Intelligence**: Customer & Market Insights, Survey Design  

## 🔥 What I’m Working On  
### ☕ **Maven Roaster Sales Analysis**  
I’m currently transforming **transactional data** from a multi-location coffee chain into a **dynamic dashboard** that provides insights on **sales patterns**, **staffing efficiency**, and **customer behavior**.  

### 🎯 **Coaching & Leadership Survey Analysis**  
Helping coaches refine their approach by **designing and analyzing surveys** that measure leadership growth, challenges, and impact.  

## 🌱 Beyond Data
