# About Me
**Hey there, I’m Romand from Portland, Oregon!** 👋  

As a **Data Analyst**, I blend my experience in **food and beverage hospitality** where I spent over a decade mastering the art of problem-solving, efficiency, and delivering top-tier experiences. Now, I apply that same mindset to **data analytics**, uncovering trends, optimizing operations, and helping businesses make smarter decisions. Now, I’m bringing that same mindset to **data analytics**, using **Power BI, SQL**, and **Excel** to help businesses streamline operations, improve decision-making, and boost performance. 

## 🍽️ From Hospitality to Data  
Working in fast-paced restaurant environments taught me how to **adapt, analyze, and improve** on the fly. Whether it was streamlining workflows, understanding customer behavior, or ensuring smooth service during rush hours, I was always looking for ways to make things better. Now, I do the same with **SQL, Power BI, and Excel**—except instead of food orders, I’m crunching numbers and building dashboards.  

## 🏙️ Portland Vibes + Data  
Living in Portland, I’ve always been surrounded by a **community-driven** spirit, which is why I love working with data that helps people and businesses grow. I’m passionate about using data to **optimize processes** and create smarter solutions, whether it’s a **local coffee shop** or a **large-scale operation**.  

## 🏀 Data with a Purpose  
I see data as a team sport:  
🏆 **Slam dunks** = When data drives meaningful **business transformation**.  
💭 **Assists** = Helping teams make **data-informed decisions** that lead to action.  
❌ **Airballs** = Every missed shot is an opportunity to **refine strategies**.  

## 💻 My Tech Stack  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Excel (PivotTables, Charts)  
- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Spreadsheets  
- **Business Intelligence**: Customer & Market Insights, Survey Design  

## 🔥 What I’m Working On  
### ☕ **Maven Roaster Sales Analysis**  
I’m currently transforming **transactional data** from a multi-location coffee chain into a **dynamic dashboard** that provides insights on **sales patterns**, **staffing efficiency**, and **customer behavior**.  

### 🎯 **Coaching & Leadership Survey Analysis**  
Developing surveys and analyzing responses to help **coaches refine their strategies** based on real feedback and impact measurement.  


## 🌱 Beyond Data  
- **Coffee Enthusiast**: Portland is home to some of the best coffee, and I’m always on the lookout for the next great brew.  
- **Curious by Nature**: I’m constantly exploring **new analytics techniques**, finding ways to optimize processes, and learning from every dataset.  
- **Local Portland Advocate**: Proud to be part of a **tech-forward city** with a vibrant **community-focused mindset**.
